//! Crate-wide error and result types.
//!
//! Every fallible public function in this crate returns [`Result`], and every
//! failure mode is a distinct [`Error`] variant. Add a variant rather than
//! encoding new context into an existing message: callers match on variants,
//! and message text is not a stable API.
//!
//! Variants carry the data a caller needs to react, keep their `#[error]`
//! message lowercase and free of trailing punctuation, and are documented so
//! the rendered rustdoc explains when each one occurs.

/// Errors returned by this crate.
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum Error {
    /// A required name was empty or contained only whitespace.
    #[error("name must not be empty")]
    EmptyName,
}

/// The crate's standard result type.
///
/// Use this alias in public signatures instead of spelling out
/// `std::result::Result<T, Error>`.
pub type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, Error>;
